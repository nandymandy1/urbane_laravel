                                        Bags are made to order and take up to 21 working days to complete. We aim to get your order to you as soon as possible. However, due to unforeseen circumstances (such as illness, weather or other such causes affecting deliveries, extremely busy order periods such as Christmas) there may be a delay to your order and it may take longer than the suggested time period.   Orders are posted between Monday and Friday. All orders are sent 1st Class Recorded Delivery.  Please ensure all delivery details are correct at time of order and again on your confirmation email.  It is the customer’s responsibility to provide us with a correct address.  Providing an address that is incomplete, incorrect, or false for whatever reason will result in your delivery being delayed, lost, or returned.  Urbane 90  is not responsible for any parcels lost due to the customer providing an incorrect address.  If you notice a problem with your address on your order, please contact us straight away.  Contacting us after dispatch is not acceptable.  Returned parcels will require postage to be paid for again.  Lost parcels are the customer’s responsibility.  Please note: all deliveries require a signature.  It is your responsibility to sign for your delivery.  Urbane90 cannot be held responsible for orders signed for by anyone other than the person listed on the order/delivery.
